I finally complete creating a blog using Next.js!\
It was pretty straight forward, and I almost feel that just anyone can do it.\
Hopefully I'll be able to modify it to my liking!\
All I did was follow Next.js' documentation. It was nice, and deployment was super easy.

oops..I pushed it too early aha...
